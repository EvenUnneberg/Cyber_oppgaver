1. How many possible keys are there in a Caesar cipher?
2. What is ROT13 and what has the “import this” statement in Python got to do with it?
3. Vigenère cipher are normally harder to break than Caesar cipher. When is this not the case?
4. Who was Vigenère?
a. When did he live?
b. What other cipher is he known for having invented?
5. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Vernam cipher?
6. There is a special case where the Vigenère cipher and the Vernam cipher are the same. What is the
condition for this to be true.
7. Vernam: (Vernam.py)
a. m = “Security is important.”
b. k = “En fin liten nøkkel, men er den god nok.”
c. c = <denne finner du ut selv>
8. Where did Kerckhoff work?
9. What does his principle mean in practice?
10. For the Caesar and Vernam cipher, knowing a (plaintext,ciphertext) pair also implies that you know
the key.
a. Can you think of a way around this severe problem?
11. Read chapter 2 “Randomness” in the book (the mathematics is only “for information”). It is part of
the curriculum.
12. What is a true random bit generator?
13. How can you construct a true random bit generator? What are the caveats?
14. What is the “next-bit” test?
15. What is a CSPRBG?
16. The Fortuna generator should be based on what kind of cipher primitive?
17. Fortuna: What are the “pools of entropy”?
18. Modify the module_secrets.py file to create a password suggestion that uses words....
19. Python: >>>import secrets
a. In interactive mode: >>> help(secrets) (and https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html)
b. Look up the PEP that is mentioned in the help output. It mentions that the standard
“random” module in Python uses the “MT” scheme. What is the “MT” method?
20. How can you test a random number generator?
a. See randu_plot.py (randu.py) and the associated Wikipedia reference for RANDU.
b. Play around with the randu_plot python file (you should be able to improve it)
c. Switch from RANDU to methods from the secrets module. Ensure that there are no planes.
21. Mention 3 different types of nonces.
22. When is it acceptable to use a time-stamp nonce? (and when is that not a good idea)
23. When is brute-force not practical?
24. What is pre-computation and why is it useful?
25. When is using a one-time pad a good solution?
26. In GSM, the key Kc is 64 bit long. Is that a problem?
27. What is a key-deriving key?
28. What is the advantage of PFS? Does it always matter?
29. Obfuscation is often used in malware. What is the Norwegian translation of malware?
30. Is obfuscation only used in malware?
31. Read the article “Hide and Seek: An Introduction to Steganography”. Check out what it says about
jsteg.
32. Why would one use steganography as a hiding method?
33. Why will one normally also encrypt the contents that is being hidden with steganographic methods?
34. “Pwn2hide.jpg” is a copy of “Pwn2own.jpg”, and it contains a hidden message. Use jsteg1 to find the
message. What is that message?
35. The message from Q-34 is a famous quote. What is the story?
36. What is a passive attack?
37. What is the difference between a chosen-plaintext attack and a known-plaintext attack?
38. What is “Schneier’s law”?
39. Can you mention a threat modelling method?
40. It was mentioned that risk is sometimes equated with probability x impact. This poses a problem for
how to evaluate probability. It is common to use statistical models, and maybe the famous bell
shape of the normal deviation. But, how do you know the distribution of incidents for new systems?
Incidents are potentially infrequent events, and then you don’t necessarily have enough data point
to determine the distribution. Thus, you don’t really know which distribution to used. This can have
consequences. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory for more information.
41. What is meant by containment?
42. What is meant by “accepting the risk”?
43. What is a Dolev-Yao Intruder model and when should it be used?
